## Project Overview 

Developed a chatbot integrated with a Flask API:

- Loaded and processed intent data from JSON files.
- Tokenized and lemmatized text using `NLTK`.
- Constructed training data with bag-of-words models and one-hot encoding.
- Built and trained a neural network using `TensorFlow/Keras` for intent classification.
- Deployed the chatbot via a Flask API for HTTP interactions.
